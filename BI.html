              <h2>Business intelligence</h2>
              <p>Business intelligence refers to the use of data analysis tools and techniques to gather, process, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources in order to gain insights and make informed business decisions. This involves transforming raw data into actionable information that can be used to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities, as well as to monitor key performance indicators and track progress towards business goals. By leveraging business intelligence, organizations can gain a competitive advantage by making data-driven decisions that optimize performance, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

            <div class="portfolio">
              <h2>Business Intelligence & Data science ? </h2>
              <p>While there is some overlap between the two, business intelligence (BI) and data science are distinct disciplines that serve different purposes.
              <br>
                Business intelligence is primarily focused on using data analysis tools and techniques to gain insights into business operations and performance. It involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources in order to produce reports, dashboards, and other visualizations that can be used to inform business decisions.
              <br>
                Data science, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses a range of techniques and methodologies for working with data. It involves using statistical analysis, machine learning, and other advanced techniques to extract insights and knowledge from complex data sets. Data science is often used for predictive modeling, forecasting, and other applications that require more sophisticated data analysis than what is typically used in BI.
                <br>
                In summary, business intelligence is focused on providing insights into existing business operations, while data science is focused on extracting new knowledge and insights from data that can be used to drive innovation and growth.</p>
              
              <h2>The general steps to obtain a BI solution </h2>
              <p>
                <ul>
              <li>Define business goals and requirements: Identify the business goals and requirements that the BI solution should address. This includes understanding the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that are important to the business.
              <br><br>
              <li>Data collection and integration: Gather data from various sources and integrate it into a single data warehouse or data lake. This includes data cleansing and transformation to ensure consistency and accuracy.
              <br><br>
              <li>Data modeling and analysis: Develop a data model that can support the business goals and requirements. This includes developing data cubes or data marts that can be used for analysis and reporting.

              </ul>
              <h2>ETL ? </h2>
              <p>ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process used to integrate data from various sources into a single data warehouse or data mart. The process involves the following steps:
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Extraction: In this step, data is extracted from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets, and flat files. The extracted data is typically in a raw format and may be incomplete or contain errors.
                <br>
                <li>Transformation: In this step, the extracted data is transformed into a format that is suitable for analysis and reporting. This includes data cleansing, data integration, data enrichment, and data validation. The transformation process may involve using data manipulation tools or programming languages such as Python or SQL.
                <br>
                <li>Loading: In this step, the transformed data is loaded into a target data warehouse or data mart. This involves mapping the transformed data to the target schema and loading the data into the database. The loading process may involve using tools or programming languages to automate the process.
                <br>
              </ul>
                The ETL process is critical to creating a reliable and accurate data warehouse or data mart. It ensures that the data is in a format that is suitable for analysis and reporting and that it is consistent and accurate. The ETL process can be complex and time-consuming, but it is essential for creating a robust BI solution.</p>
